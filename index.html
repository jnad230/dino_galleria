            <h1>Explore some of time's greatest reptiles, virtually</h1>
            <p>Dinosaurs are a type of reptile that originally appeared around 245 million years ago. They ruled the
                earth until 66 million years ago, when an extinction catastrophe wiped off a huge portion of life on the
                planet. However, thanks to Palanteologists and evolving tech we have been able to revive them.</p>

                    <h2>Tyrannosaurus</h2>
                    <p>
                        Often known as Trex is one of the most rapacious predator to have walked on Earth. Tyrannosaurus
                        rex literally means “Tyrant lizard king” and there is no doubt it lived up to its name. With a
                        speed of 27km/h, you and I could actually outwalk the giant lizard. Though it remains gigantic
                        as it was 3.7m to 6.1m in height. The longest any Trex has been known to live is 30 years. This
                        specimen was extracted in 2013 by a team paleontologists from the Netherlands.</p>

                    <h2>Dromaeosaurus</h2>
                    <p>
                        A small carnivorous lizard with a length of 6.6 feet and weight of 45 Kgs. They had a keen sight
                        and large eyes. The term “Dromaeosaurus” translates to a “swift running lizard”. Due to close
                        relation to Velociraptor they possessed very similar physical and dietary features. The first
                        known dromaesaurus was excavated in 1914 by the American Museum of Natural History.</p>

                    <h2>Spinosaurus</h2>
                    <p> 
                        As the name suggests spinosaurus-“Spine lizard” was known for its exceptionally protruding spines called “sail”. The animals back vertebrae alone was upto 7 feet tall. A partial skeleton discovered by Ernst Stromer was destroyed after an accidental bombing of the Museum in Munich housing the remains. This left Stromer’s monographics as the only source of descriptive information of the creature until additional fragmentary remains were discovered later.

                    <h2>Brachiosaurus</h2>
                    <p>Brachiosaurus literally means “arm lizard” and this was derived from the vividly larger forelimbs than hind limbs. It was a small herbivorous four-legged sauropod. However, unlike other sauropods, brachiosaurus had a giraffe like build with a long neck and tail. This indicates the need for a powerful cardiovascular-system in order to pump blood from its chest to the head.</p>

                    <p>
                        A small to medium sized bird like dinosaur, surprisingly, roughly the size of a turkey. The word
                        velociraptor is derived from “velox" (swift) and "raptor" (robber or plunderer) accrediting it’s
                        carnivorous appetite. The creature was only 6 foot tall with a weight of about 45 KGs.
                        Naturally, it was one of the fastest dinasours and could sprint at a speed of 40MPH!</p>

                    <h2>Brontosaurus</h2>
                        <p>Brontosaurus, meaning 'thunder lizard' derived from Greek, was discovered in 1879. Brontosaurus was a large, heavy quadrupedal animal with a long neck and tiny head suitable for its herbivorous lifestyle. They are said to have a staggering weight of 15,000kg and a towering height of 72 feet. Due to it being the archetypal sauropod, Brontosaurus is very famously known and used occasionally in films, advertisements and other forms of modern media.

                    <h2>Stegosaurus</h2>
                    <p>Stegosaurus, also referred to as 'roof lizard' were large, heavily compact herbivorous quadrupeds; their remains that were discovered in Colorado. Stegosaurus had a short neck and tiny head with a low brain to body ratio which indicated that it mostly ate bushes and shrubs to suit its herbivorous lifestyle and diet. Fossils of this creature dating back around 150 million years were found in North America and in Europe (Portugal).</p>

                    <h2>Ankylosaurus</h2>
                    <p>Ankylosaurus, known for its massive height and size, was a type of armoured dinosaur. Its size rather than modern land animals was quite large with former scientists plotting it at 11 meters (36 feet); although later reconstructions have devised a downsize at around 6 feet (20 feet). While a handful of these specimens have been excavated, a proper complete skeleton was never found. Ankylosaurus is commonly described as the archetypal member of its group.
